Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, tracks and manages changes, and helps in maintaining a history of modifications.

Git and Version Control
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to manage and track changes to their codebase. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git provides each developer with a complete copy of the entire repository, including its full history. This allows for more robust and flexible workflows.

Key Concepts in Git Version Control:
Repository:

A repository (or "repo") is the place where your project files and their revision history are stored.
Commit:

A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It records the state of the files and directories, along with a message describing the changes.
Branch:

A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It allows you to work on different features or bug fixes independently of the main codebase.
Merge:

Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is typically done when a feature or bug fix is complete.
Clone:

Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a repository, including its history, on your local machine.
Pull and Push:

Pulling updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository.
Pushing sends your local changes to a remote repository.
Remote:

A remote is a version of your repository hosted on the internet or another network.
Staging Area:

The staging area is where you prepare changes to be committed. It's like a holding area for changes that will be part of the next commit.
